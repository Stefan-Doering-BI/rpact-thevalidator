\title{RPACT - R Package for Adaptive Clinical Trials}
\description{
RPACT is a comprehensive package that enables the design and analysis of confirmatory 
adaptive group sequential designs. 
Particularly, the methods described in the recent 
\href{http://monograph.wassmer.brannath.rpact.com}{monograph by Wassmer and Brannath} 
(published by Springer, 2016) are implemented.
}
\details{
RPACT includes the classical group sequential designs (incl. user spending function approaches) 
where the sample sizes per stage 
(or the time points of interim analysis) cannot be changed in a data-driven way. 
Confirmatory adaptive designs explicitly allow for this under control of the Type I error rate.
They are either based on the combination testing or the conditional rejection probability (CRP) principle.
Both are available, for the former the inverse normal combination test and Fisher's combination test can be used.

Specific results of the adaptive methodology are also available, e.g., 
overall confidence intervals and p-values and conditional and predictive power assessments.

Designs are available for trials with continuous, binary, and survival endpoint.
