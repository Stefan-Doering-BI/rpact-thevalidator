\title{Get Power And Average Sample Number}
\usage{
getPowerAndAverageSampleNumber(design, theta = seq(-1, 1, 0.02),
  nMax = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{The design.}

\item{theta}{A vector of standardized effect sizes.}

\item{nMax}{The maximum sample size.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{\link{PowerAndAverageSampleNumberResult}} object.
}
\description{
Returns the power and average sample number of the specified design.
}
\details{
This function returns the power and average sample number (ASN) of the specified design for the prototype case which is testing H0: mu = mu0 in a one-sample design.
theta represents the standardized effect (mu - mu0)/sigma and power and ASN is calculated for maximum sample size nMax.
For other designs than the one-sample test of a mean the standardized effect needs to be adjusted accordingly.

getPowerAndAverageSampleNumber(
    getDesignGroupSequential(), 
    theta = seq(-1, 1, 0.5), nMax = 100)
