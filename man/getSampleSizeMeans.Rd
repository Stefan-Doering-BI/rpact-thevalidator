\usage{
getSampleSizeMeans(design = NULL, ..., normalApproximation = FALSE,
  meanRatio = FALSE, thetaH0 = ifelse(meanRatio, 1, 0),
  alternative = C_ALTERNATIVE_DEFAULT, stDev = C_STDEV_DEFAULT,
  groups = 2, allocationRatioPlanned = NA_real_)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{The trial design. If no trial design is specified, a fixed sample size design is used. 
   In this case, \code{alpha}, \code{beta}, \code{twoSidedPower}, 
and \code{sided} can be directly entered as argument.}

\item{...}{Ensures that all arguments are be named and 
that a warning will be displayed if unknown arguments are passed.}

\item{normalApproximation}{If \code{normalApproximation = TRUE} is specified, the variance is 
assumed to be known, default is FALSE, i.e., the calculations are performed 
with the t distribution.}

\item{meanRatio}{If \code{meanRatio = TRUE} is specified, the sample size for 
one-sided testing of H0: mu1/mu2 = thetaH0 is calculated, default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{thetaH0}{The null hypothesis value. For one-sided testing, a value != 0 
(or a value != 1 for testing the mean ratio) can be specified, default is 
\code{0} or \code{1} for difference and ratio testing, respectively.}

\item{alternative}{The alternative hypothesis value. This can be a vector of assumed 
alternatives, default is \code{seq(0.2,1,0.2)}.}

\item{stDev}{The standard deviation, default is 1. If \code{meanRatio = TRUE} 
is specified, stDev defines the coefficient of variation sigma/mu2.}

\item{groups}{The number of treatment groups (1 or 2), default is \code{2}.}

\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{The planned allocation ratio for a two treatment groups 
design, default is 1. If \code{allocationRatioPlanned = 0} is entered, 
   the optimal allocation ratio yielding the smallest overall sample size is determined.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{\link{TrialDesignPlanMeans}} object.
}
\description{
Returns the sample size for testing means in one or two samples.
}
\details{
At given design the function calculates the stage-wise (non-cumulated) and maximum 
sample size for testing means.
In a two treatment groups design, additionally, an allocation ratio = n1/n2 can be specified. 
A null hypothesis value thetaH0 != 0 for testing the difference of two means or  
thetaH0 != 1 for testing the ratio of two means can be specified.
Critical bounds and stopping for futility bounds are provided at the effect scale 
(mean, mean difference, or mean ratio, respectively) for each sample size calculation separately.

\examples{
 
# Calculate sample sizes in a fixed sample size parallel group design 
# with allocation ratio n1/n2 = 2 for a range of alternative values 1,...,5 
# with assumed standard deviation = 3.5; two-sided alpha = 0.05, power 1 - beta = 90\%:
getSampleSizeMeans(alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.1, sided = 2, groups = 2, 
    alternative = seq(1, 5, 1), stDev = 3.5, allocationRatioPlanned = 2)

# Calculate sample sizes in a three-stage Pocock paired comparison design testing 
# H0: mu = 2 for a range of alternative values 3,4,5 with assumed standard 
# deviation = 3.5; one-sided alpha = 0.05, power 1 - beta = 90\%:
getSampleSizeMeans(getDesignGroupSequential(typeOfDesign = "P", alpha = 0.05, 
    sided = 1, beta = 0.1), groups = 1, thetaH0 = 2, 
    alternative = seq(3, 5, 1), stDev = 3.5)
